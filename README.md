BatchGuard is a lightweight Windows batch-based defensive security tool developed for educational, cybersecurity learning, and defensive research purposes.

This project demonstrates how signature-based detection, hashing mechanisms, logging systems, and controlled quarantine workflows can be implemented using native Windows command-line utilities.

BatchGuard is NOT a replacement for professional antivirus software. It is designed as a learning project for:

- Cybersecurity students
- Blue Team beginners
- Defensive scripting practice
- Virtual lab experimentation
- Portfolio demonstration

## Core Capabilities

- Signature-based scanning
- SHA256 hash logging via certutil
- Safe quarantine system
- System folder protection
- User-confirmed remediation
- EXTREME ANALYSIS MODE (advanced heuristic scan)

## Project Philosophy

BatchGuard focuses on:

- Transparency
- Simplicity
- Educational value
- Safe experimentation

No kernel drivers.
No real-time monitoring.
No stealth behavior.
No persistence mechanisms.

This repository is intended to showcase defensive scripting concepts in a controlled environment.

FOR EDUCATIONAL AND DEFENSIVE RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.
